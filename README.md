Description
This website allows users to take a timed multiple choice quiz about City Planning. By answering incorrectly, 10 seconds is deducted from the users overall time of 60 seconds. By answering correctly, the user gains 10 points. When the time runs out, the user is prompted to input their initials in order to receive their overall score when time ran out or all answers have been selected correctly.

Remember, if you choose incorrectly on any question, you will be prompted to choose another question and you will have 10 seconds deducted, so choose wisely!

Known Bugs
- Text input for initials at end of game does not currently dissappear once they have been entered.
- HTML code has been written for individual elements. This should eventually be rewritten in one component so that many elements can be added with less effort on the developers part.
